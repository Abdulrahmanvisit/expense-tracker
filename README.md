💰 expense-tracker

Expense Tracker is a clean, responsive, and interactive web application that helps users manage their daily finances with ease. Whether you want to track your spending habits, monitor income, or simply gain more control over your money, this app provides a simple and elegant solution right in your browser.

🧾 Description

Expense Tracker is designed to make personal finance management effortless and accessible. With this tool, you can easily add your income and expenses, categorize them, and instantly see how they affect your total balance. Every transaction you make updates in real time, giving you a clear view of where your money goes.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app runs entirely in your browser — no database or server required. Your financial data is safely stored using localStorage, which means your records remain available even after closing or refreshing the page.

The design is minimal yet modern, focusing on simplicity and functionality. Whether on desktop or mobile, the layout adjusts seamlessly for a smooth experience.

Expense Tracker isn’t just a personal finance tool — it’s also a great front-end project for beginners looking to strengthen their understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and data persistence in JavaScript.
